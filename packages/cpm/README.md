CPM (CommonJS Package Manager) is designed for simple, straightforward installation
of CommonJS packages into a target location/package. This is specifically designed to
make it easy to install packages for use in the browser or any server side JS 
environment (like Node). CPM is based on the CommonJS Mappings specification,
and will install all dependencies listed in the mappings.
