## Usage

    volo.js rejuvenate [flags] [archive#path/to/volo.js]

It will replace volo.js with the most recent version tag of volo.js.

By default it uses **jrburke/volo#dist/volo.js** for the archive, but you
can use any archive value that is supported by the **add** command. Just
be sure to list the path to volo.js in the archive.

rejuvenate accepts the same flags as the **add** command. It explicitly forces
the install via the add commands -f flag.

I you want to live on the edge, then you could use the following command:

    volo.js rejuvenate jrburke/volo/master#dist/volo.js

## Notes

The user running this command needs to have write access to the directory that
contains volo.js so the volo directory can be created and have file installed
into it.
